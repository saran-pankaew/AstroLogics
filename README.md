This is a repository of data, code and analyses of AstroLogics framework.
A step-by step tutorial cna be found in the folder tutorial. Pelase have a look at our tutorial [add link to the tutorial page]. 

## Getting Started
### Requirements (for AstroLogics)
- Python version 3.8 or greater
- Python's packages listed here:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scipy, sklearn
    - maboss
    - boolsim
    - bonesis
    - mpbn

## Overview
AstroLogics is a Python package designed for analysing monotonous Boolean model ensemble, a product of Boolean model synthesis from method such as Bonesis.

Our framework includes two major processes 
1. Dynamical properties analysis : 
    - Calculated distance between models through probabilistic approxmition via MaBoSS [add ref to MaBoSS].
2. Logical function evaluation : 
    - Features logical equation and identify key logical features between model clusters
